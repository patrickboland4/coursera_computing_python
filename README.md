# Interactive Programming in Python - mini projects
[Interactive Programming in Python] (https://www.coursera.org/course/interactivepython2), part of the [Fundamentals of Computing Specialization] (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/fundamentalscomputing2) on Coursera, provides an in depth look at the core structures of the python language through the implementation of weekly mini projects. From Blackjack, to Asteroids, mini projects take the form of interactive games using [CodeSkulptor] (http://www.codeskulptor.org/), an online Python development tool created by Scott Rixner of Rice University.

To run the projects within this repository, click the project name and within the CodeSkulptor window, click the run button in the upper left corner.
